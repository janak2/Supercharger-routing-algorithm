The objective is to construct a search algorithm to find the minimum time path through the tesla
network of supercharging stations. Each supercharger will refuel the vehicle at a different rate
given in km/hr of charge time. The route does not have to fully charge at every visited charger,
so long as it never runs out of charge between two chargers. 


Charger network data in the format:

	name, latitude in degrees, longitude in degrees, charge rate in km/hr


Input: The program takes as input two strings: “start charger name”, “end charger name"


Output: The program’s only output is a print to std::out of a string in the format:

		initial charger name, first charger name, charge time in hrs, 
		second charger name, charge time in hrs, …, …, goal charger name


Assumptions:

	The car begins at the start charger with a full charge of 320km
	The car travels at a constant speed of 105km/hr along great circle routes between chargers
	The Earth is a sphere of radius 6356.752km
